[BioScholar](http://www.bioscholar.org) is a knowledge management and engineering system for biomedical informatics. The purpose of this system is to provide software for experimental biomedical scientists that would permit a single scientific worker (at the level of a graduate student or postdoctoral worker) to design, construct and manage a shared knowledge repository for a research group derived on a local store of PDF files. We especially emphasize usability within a laboratory so that this software could provide support to experimental scientists attempting to construct a personalized representation of their own knowledge on a medium scale.

BioScholar is a development of the Biomedical Knowledge Engineering Group at the [University of Southern California](http://www.usc.edu/)'s [Information Sciences Institute](http://www.isi.edu/), in collaboration with the Biomedical Informatics Research Network.  Further description is available its home page.
